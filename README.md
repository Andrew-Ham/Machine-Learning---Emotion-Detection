<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I wanted to create a small machine learning project to challenge myself and learn more on machine learning. I picked an area I am fascinated about which is 
psychology and was intrigued in the use of machine learning/AI in psychology related fields.
<p> I was able to practise more on visualising the data, cleaning the data etc.
